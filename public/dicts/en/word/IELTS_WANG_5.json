direct”（引导）的意思。所以address可以表示“将信件引导至某处”，即在信封上写上投递地址，后来演变为名词，表示“地址”。address还可以表示“将精力或注意力引导至某件事”，即“致力于”的意思。address还可以表示演讲，因为演讲其实就是将自己的意见引导至观众头脑中，所以表示“演讲”时address指的是正式的、精心准备好的演讲。\naddress：[ə'dres]

 英语单词cannibal就源自西班牙语Caniba，原本指的就是加勒比土著，因为有关他们的食人传说，使得单词cannibal逐渐变成了“食人者”的代名词。\n \n  cannibal：n.食人者，吃同类的动物adj.食人的，吃同类的\n cannibalism：n.食人的行为，同类相残的行为\n Carib：n.加勒比人\n

一词即被用作“食人生番”的同义词。其词义变化很可能也受了意为“犬”的西班牙语canino 一词的影响，因为未开化的人和狗一样都吃人肉。Canibales一词被英语吸收后即失去其原先与加勒比土著的联系，拼作cannibal，表示“食人生番”、“食人者”或“同类相食的动物”。"}]},{"id":7486,"word":"connect","phonetic0":" kəˈnekt

来自拉丁语collegium."},{"t":"college:（学院）：提供给学生的住宿机构","d":"在中世纪大学中，最初并没有集中的校舍，学生自行解决食宿问题。后来，为了解决贫困学生以及外地学生的食宿问题，一些私人捐赠的慈善机构出现，为大学生提供住宿。这种提供给大学生的住宿机构就是college（学院），通常由一个住宿部、一个食堂、一个小礼拜堂和一座图书馆构成。欧洲最早的学院是1180年设立于巴黎的迪克斯—惠特学院，它是为18名贫穷的学生提供住处而设立的。\n  13世纪后，学院发展迅速，学院内的老师除了管理职能外，还承担了指导职能，给住在学院内的大学生提供一些额外的课程，一般由教授或住在学院内的助教开设。随着这些教育活动的增多，在某些大学，学院逐渐垄断了大学的文科教学，使得学院成为大学生生活和教学的正式中心。到16世纪中期，大多数英国和巴黎的学院已经发展成为向本科学生和研究生提供教学的自给自足的教学单位，很多学院的名气甚至超过了所在大学。\n 英语中表示“学院”的单词college来自拉丁语collegium，后缀um表示“场所”。该词字面意思就是“community of colleague”（由colleague组成的社区，一群人在一起生活、学习的场所）。colleague就是一起做事的人，可以是同事，也可以是同学。\n  college原本仅仅表示university（综合性大学）中的一个学院，但后来，college还可以用来表示独立的教育机构，如专科大学、职业教育学校，还可以用来表示“学会”，很多人还喜欢直接用college来表示大学。\n college：['kɒlɪdʒ] n.学院，专科大学，大学，学会。\n colleague：['kɒliːg] n.同事，同僚，同仁。"},{"t":"college:学院","d":"来自colleague, 一群有共同点的人，同事。后来该词用于学术用语，即一起工作师生。"},{"t":"college:学院","d":"这个词一般指综合大学中的学院，如哈佛大学内的文学院、理学院等；也可指独立的学院，如师范学院（a teachers college）、农学院（a college of agriculture）、医学院（a medical college）等。它来源的拉丁语的collegium一词，col 即“with”， lego，“choose”， 意即大学生是被“选拔在一起”到这里业学习的。"},{"t":"college:大学，学院","d":"来源于拉丁语中由com-(共同)和动词legare(代理,委托→选择)组成的复合词collega。   \n 词根词缀：

Spangler）发明了第一台家用真空吸尘器并获得专利。斯庞格勒患有哮喘病，扫地时扬起的灰尘常常令他难受，因此他自己动手，用电机、锡质肥皂箱、丝缎枕头套和一个墩布把等部件组装了一台小型的真空吸尘器。当时他制造这样一台机器需要花费两到三周时间。后来，他把其中一台吸尘器借给了自己的表妹。他的表妹的丈夫威廉·胡佛（William Hoover）原是一名皮革制品制造商，他的生意因为受到汽车普及的冲击而非常惨淡。他看到了这种家用真空吸尘器的市场潜力，便从斯庞格勒手中购买了专利，开始大规模生产这种吸尘器，并为此成立了胡佛公司。\n  在市场销售初期，消费者对吸尘器一无所知，因此无法打开销路。因此，胡佛在报纸上刊登广告，宣称顾客可以免费使用10天。就这样，市场对吸尘器的需求开始猛增，胡佛牌吸尘器的销量突飞猛进，在全球很多国家都得到了应用，以至于从Hoover这个姓氏中衍生了英语单词Hoover，做名词时表示吸尘器，做动词时表示用吸尘器给房间除尘。\n hoover：['huv]

dismissed”。显然，这是神父遣散全体参与者的用语。到了公元8世纪，其中missa一词开始被用以指整个弥撒仪式，进人中世纪英语作masse，最后演变为mass。可见mass原来的含义为dismissal（解散，遗散），而汉语“弥撒”则为拉丁语missa之音译，而绝非译自英语。若再进一步追根溯源的话，我们可发现missa派生自拉丁动词mittere‘to

Jenner）发现挤奶女工从来不会得天花。他观察并认为，这是因为挤奶女工容易感染牛身上的一种轻微天花——牛痘（cowpox）。因此，琴纳想出了通过接种牛痘使人获得对天花的免疫力的方法。1796年，琴纳的接种牛痘试验获得成功。从此以后，接种疫苗的方法得到大力推广，现在天花基本上已经销声匿迹。\n 琴纳将用于人体接种的牛痘苗称为vaccine

'cow'（母牛）的派生词vaccīnus 'of a cow'（母牛的）。起初vaccine仅作形容词用，19世纪初由vaccine派生出动词vaccinate（种痘；接种）和名词vaccination（种痘；接种）。到了19世纪40年代vaccine virus缩略为vaccine, vaccine开始由形容词转类为名词，直接用以指“牛痘苗”。之后它的词义扩展了，凡用于预防疾病而接种的疫苗人们均称作vaccine。据传，是法国微生物学家巴斯德（Louis Pasteur, 1822-1895）为了纪念詹纳的功绩率先将vaccine和vaccination分别用于广义上的“疫苗”和“接种”的。"},{"t":"vaccine:疫苗","d":"来自拉丁语
