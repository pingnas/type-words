    "text": "Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies. \nThis is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and old not emit light. \nFinding planets is proving hard enough, \nbut finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. \nThe first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. \nIn our won solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. \nOnly the Earth provides ideal conditions, \nand even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve. \n\nWhether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. \nImagine a star up t twenty times larger, brighter, brighter and hotter than our own sun. \nA planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. \nAlternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. \nBut how would we find such a planet? \nAt present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. \nThe development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century. \n\nIt is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. \nOur own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. \nEven a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system. \nA telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, \nbecause the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. \nOnce we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, \nso that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. \nIn the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. \nThe life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. \nIt is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. \nFor most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. \nAs Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. \nBut this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. \nIf we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. \nAs Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. \nNo human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it.\"",
    "textTranslate": "天文学的最新发展使我们能够探测到银河系和其他星系中的行星。 \n这是一项重大成就，因为相对而言，行星非常小，而且很古老，不发光。 \n事实证明，寻找行星已经够难的了， \n但事实证明，在它们身上找到生命将更加困难。 \n首先要回答的问题是，一颗行星是否真的可以支持生命。 \n例如，在我们的太阳系中，金星太热，火星太冷，无法维持生命。 \n只有地球提供了理想的条件， \n即使在这里，植物和动物的进化也需要40多亿年。 \n\n一颗行星能否维持生命取决于其恒星（即“太阳”）的大小和亮度。 \n想象一下，一颗比我们的太阳大20倍、更亮、更亮和更热的恒星。 \n一颗行星必须离它很远才能支持生命。 \n或者，如果这颗恒星很小，那么支持生命的行星就必须绕着它有一个很近的轨道，并为生命形式的发展提供完美的条件。 \n但我们如何找到这样一颗行星呢？ \n目前，还没有能够探测到生命存在的望远镜。 \n这种望远镜的研制将是二十一世纪伟大的天文工程之一。 \n\n使用地球上的望远镜在另一个星球上寻找生命是不可能的。 \n我们自己的温暖大气层和望远镜产生的热量将使我们无法探测到像行星这样小的物体。 \n即使是绕地球轨道运行的望远镜，如非常成功的哈勃望远镜，也不适合，因为太阳系中有铁粒子。 \n望远镜必须离木星那么远才能在外太空寻找生命， \n因为我们越靠近太阳系的外缘，尘埃就越薄。 \n一旦我们探测到一颗行星，我们就必须找到一种方法来遮挡其恒星的光线， \n以便我们能够正确地“看到”这颗行星并分析其大气层。 \n首先，我们会寻找植物，而不是“小绿人”。 \n最有可能在行星上形成的生命形式是细菌。 \n正是细菌产生了我们在地球上呼吸的氧气。 \n在地球历史的大部分时间里，它们是我们星球上唯一的生命形式。 \n作为地球上的居民，我们总是希望有小绿人来拜访我们，我们能够与他们交流。 \n但这种希望总是存在于科幻小说的领域。 \n如果我们能够在另一个星球上发现低等生命形式的细菌，这将彻底改变我们对自己的看法。 \n正如美国国家航空航天局的丹尼尔·戈尔丁所观察到的那样，“在其他地方发现生命将改变一切。 \n任何人类的努力或思想都不会因此而改变。”",

    "text": "Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. \nWithout it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion;everything would be in state of chaos. \nOnly in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. \nIn ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. \nThe intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. \nHe is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. \nBut people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. \nIt is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, \nso they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. \nIf no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tires, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. \nThey are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. \nThe over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. \nThe guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. \nSome friends of my family had this irritating habit. \nThe only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. \nThen they arrived just when we wanted them. \n\nIf you are citing a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minted too late. \nAlthough being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one;and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. \nAn even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. \nSuch an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone. \n\nShe entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. \nShe gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. \nTo her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. \nShe felt inhere handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down al the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. \nHe agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, \nbut only to take on mail, not passengers. \nThe girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. \nThe porter went to fetch one and arrive back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station;this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail. \nJust as that moment the train came into the station. \nThe girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's van. \nBut the station master was adamant:rules could not be broken and she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind.",
    "textTranslate": "在文明社会，守时是所有公共事务中不可或缺的习惯。 \n没有它，任何事情都无法得出结论；一切都会陷入混乱。 \n只有在人口稀少的农村社区，才有可能忽视它。 \n在日常生活中，可以容忍不守时。 \n正在研究一些深奥问题的知识分子，已经为手头的事情协调和组织好了一切。 \n因此，如果他参加晚宴迟到，可以原谅。 \n但人们经常因为不准时而受到责备，而他们唯一的错误就是把事情做得很好。 \n精力充沛、思维敏捷的人很难浪费时间， \n因此，他们经常想在出发赴约之前完成一项工作。 \n如果途中没有发生爆胎、交通改道、大雾突然降临等事故，他们就会准时到达。 \n他们往往比那些从不迟到的人更勤奋、更有用。 \n过分守时和不守时对别人来说都是一种考验。 \n提前半小时到达的客人是最大的麻烦。 \n我家的一些朋友有这个恼人的习惯。 \n唯一能做的就是让他们比其他客人晚半个小时来。 \n然后他们就在我们想要的时候到了。 \n\n如果你引用的是火车，那么早到舒适总是比晚到一小部分要好。 \n虽然早起可能意味着浪费一点时间，但这比你错过火车，不得不等一个小时或更长时间等下一班火车要少；而且你可以避免在火车驶出车站而无法上车的那一刻到达的沮丧。 \n更难的情况是，在火车进站的时候，仍然看到火车在没有你的情况下开走。 \n一个年轻女孩第一次独自旅行时，就有过这样的经历。 \n\n她在火车到站前二十分钟进入车站，因为她的父母告诉她，错过火车是不可原谅的，她要留下来的朋友要两次去接她。 \n她把行李交给搬运工，给他看了票。 \n令她惊恐的是，他说她太早两个小时了。 \n她摸了摸手提包里的那张纸，爸爸在上面写下了旅途的所有细节，然后把它交给了搬运工。 \n他同意报纸上的时间确实有一列火车进站，而且确实停了下来， \n但只收邮件，不收乘客。 \n女孩要求看时刻表，她确信父亲不会犯这样的错误。 \n搬运工去拿了一个，然后和站长一起回来了，站长把它摆了出来，在火车到达车站的时间旁边指着一个微小的“o”；这个小“o”表示火车只停下来收邮件。 \n就在那一刻，火车进站了。 \n女孩泪流满面，恳求允许她溜进警卫的货车。 \n但站长态度坚决：规则不能违反，她必须看着那列火车消失在她的目的地，而她却被甩在后面。",
