It' \nflies',therefore, \nbut it cannot fly higher--its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides. \n\nThe first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation. \nThe hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, \nand sat down on a road. \nLater it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem. \n\nSince that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service. \nThe hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia;it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl',carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports;giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic;and the railway of the future may well be the' hovertrain',riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds up to 300 m.p.h.--the possibilities appear unlimited. \n\n--EGON LARSEN The Pegasus Book of Inventors--",

M. S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. \nA burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to there miles deep, \nand the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude. \n\nToday, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn and we know something of the great variety of the sea bed's topography. \nSince the sea covers the greater part of the earth's surface, it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the earth, with, superimposed upon, it the continents, together with the islands and other features of the oceans. \nThe continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean. \nFrom the shore line, out a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents. \nThe real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot a steeper slope. \n\nThis continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fatheom mark and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2,500-3,500 fathoms. \nThe slope averages about 1 in 30. \nbut contains steep, probably vertical, cliffs, \nand gentle sediment-covered terraces, \nand near its lower reaches there is a long tailing-off which is almost certainly the result of material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses. \n\n--T.F.GASKELL Exploring the Sea-floor from Science Survey--",

    "text": "An earthquake comes like a thief in the night, without warning. \nIt was necessary, therefore, to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept. \nSome devices were quite simple. \nOne, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses with would stand up end like ninepins. \nWhen a shock came, it shook the rigid table upon which these stood. \nIf it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell. \nIf it were severe, they all fell. \nThus the rods, by falling, \nand by the direction in which they fell, recorded for the severe, they all fell. \nThus the rods, by falling, \nand by the direction in which they fell, recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to waken him, \nand the direction from which it came. \n\nBut instruments far more deliecate than that were needed if any really serious advance was to be made. \nThe ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument that could record with a pen on paper, the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by. \nWhile I write my pen moves, but the paper keeps still. \nWith practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved. \nThat sounds a silly suggestion, \nbut that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments (seismometers) for recording earthquake waves. \nBut when table, penholder and paper are all moving, how is it possible to write legibly? \nThe key to a solution of that problem lay in an everyday observation. \nWhy does a person standing in a bus or train tend to fall when a sudden start is made? \nIt is because his feet move on , but his head stays still. \nA simple experiment will help us a little further. \nTie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string. \nWith the hand to and fro and around but not up and string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. \nNow move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down. \nIt will be found that the weight a piece of string. \nWith the hand held high in the air, hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. \nNow move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down. \nIt will be found that ten weight moves but slightly or not at all. \nImagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, the paper, you and your hand. \nIn the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still. \nBut as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, its movement would be recorded in ink upon its surface. \nIt was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, \nbut while the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side. \nThe apparatus thus described, however, records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated. \nIf we could actually see the path described by a particle, such as a sand grain in the rock, it would be more like that of a bluebottle path described by a particle, such as a sand grain in the rock, it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room;it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side. \nInstruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs. \n\nWhen the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre, the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after at short intervals. \nThe first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations. \nThe second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first. \nThese two have travelled through the earth. \nIt was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth. \nThe third, or main. \nThe third, or main wave, is the slowest and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks. \n\n--H.H,SWINNERTON The Earth beneath Us--",

    "text": "We must conclude from the work of those who have studied the origin of life, that given a planet only approximately like our own, life is almost certain to start. \nOf all the planets in our solar system, we ware now pretty certain the Earth is the only one on which life can survive. \nMars is too dry and poor in oxygen, Venus far too hot, \nand so is Mercury, \nand the outer planets have temperatures near absolute zero and hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. \nBut other suns, start as the astronomers call them, are bound to have planets like our own, \nand as is the number of stars in the universe is so vast, this possibility becomes virtual certainty. \nThere are one hundred thousand million starts in our own Milky Way alone, \nand then there are exist is now estimated at about 300 million million. \n\nAlthough perhaps only 1 per cent of the life that has started somewhere will develop into highly complex and intelligent patterns, \nso vast is the number of planets, that intelligent life is bound to be a natural part of the universe. \n\nIf then we are so certain that other intelligent life exists in the universe, why have we had no visitors from outer space yet? \nFirst of all, they may have come to this planet of ours thousands or millions of years ago, \nand found our then prevailing primitive state completely uninteresting to their own advanced knowledge. \nProfessor Ronald Bracewell, a leading American radio astronomer, argued in Nature that such a superior civilization, on a visit to our own solar system, may have left an automatic messenger behind to await the possible awakening of an advanced civilization. \nSuch a messenger, receiving our radio and television signals, might well re-transmit them back to its home-planet, although what impression any other civilization would thus get from us is best left unsaid. \n\nBut here we come up against the most difficult of all obstacles to contact with people on other planets--the astronomical distances which separate us. \nAs a reasonable guess, they might, on an average, be 100 light years away. \n(A light year is the distance which light travels at 186,000 miles per second in one year, namely 6 million million miles.) Radio waves also travel at the speed of light, \nand assuming such an automatic messenger picked up our first broadcasts of the 1920's, the message to its home planet is barely halfway there. \nSimilarly, our own present primitive chemical rockets, though good enough to orbit men, have no chance of transporting us to the nearest other star, four light years away, let alone distances of tens or hundreds of light years. \n\nFortunately, there is a 'uniquely rational way' for us to communicate with other intelligent beings, as Walter Sullivan has put it in his excellent book, We Are not Alone. \nThis depends on the precise radio frequency of the 21-cm wavelength, or 1420 megacycles per second. \nIt is the natural frequency of emission of the hydrogen atoms in space and was discovered by us in 1951;it must be known to any kind of radio astronomer in the universe. \n\nOnce the existence of this wave-length had been discovered, it was not long before its use as the uniquely recognizable broadcasting frequency for interstellar communication was suggested. \nWithout something of this kind, searching for intelligences on other planets would be like trying to meet a friend in London without a pre-arranged rendezvous and absurdly wandering the streets in the hope of a chance encounter. \n\n--ANTHONY MICHAELIS Are There Strangers in Space? \nfrom The Weekend Telegraph--",

    "text": "Economy is one powerful motive for camping, since after the initial outlay upon equipment, or through hiring it, the total expense can be far less than the cost of hotels. \nBut, contrary to a popular assumption, it is far from being the only one, or even the greatest. \nThe man who manoeuvres carelessly into his twenty pounds 'worth of space at one of Europe's myriad permanent sites may find himself bumping a Bentley. \nMore likely, Ford Escort will be hub to hub with Renault or Mercedes, \nbut rarely with bicycles made for two. \n\nThat the equipment of modern camping becomes yearly more sophisticated is an entertaining paradox for the cynic, a brighter promise for the hopeful traveler who has sworn to get away from it all. \nIt also provides-and some student sociologist might care to base his thesis upon the phenomenon--an escape of another kind. \nThe modern traveller is often a man who dislikes the Splendide and the Bellavista, not because he cannot afford, or shuns their material comforts. \nbut because he is afford of them. \nAffluent he may be, \nbut he is by no means sure what to tip the doorman or the chambermaid. \nMaster in his own house, he has little idea of when to say boo to a maitre d'hotel \n\nFrom all such fears camping releases him. \nGranted, a snobbery of camping itself, based upon equipment and techniques, already exists;but it is of a kind that, if he meets it, he can readily understand and deal with. \nThere is no superior 'they' in the shape of managements and hotel hierarchies to darken his holiday days. \n\nTo such motives, yet another must be added. \nThe contemporary phenomenon of car worship is to be explained not least by the sense of independence and freedom that ownership entails. \nTo this pleasure camping gives an exquisite refinement. \nFrom one's own front door to home or foreign hills or sands and back again, everything is to hand. \nNot only are the means of arriving at the holiday paradise entirely within one's own command and keeping, \nbut the means of escape from holiday hel (if the beach proves too crowded, the local weather too inclement) are there, outside--or, as likely, part of--the tent. \n\nIdealists have objected to the package tour, that the traveller abroad thereby denies himself the opportunity of getting to know the people of the country visited. \nInsularity and self-containment, it is argued, go hand in hand. \nThe opinion does not survive experience of a popular Continental camping place. \nHoliday hotels tend to cater for one nationality of visitors especially, sometimes exclusively. \nCamping sites, by contrast, are highly cosmopolitan. \nGranted, a preponderance of Germans is a characteristic that seems common to most Mediterranean sites;but as yet there is no overwhelmingly specialized patronage. \nNotices forbidding the open-air drying of clothes, or the use of water points for car washing, or those inviting 'our camping friends' to a dance or a boat trip are printed not only in French or Italian or Spanish, \nbut also in English, German and Dutch. \nAt meal times the odour of sauerkraut vies with that of garlic. \nThe Frenchman's breakfast coffee competes with the Englishman's bacon and eggs. \n\nWhether the remarkable growth of organized camping means the eventual death of the more independent kind is hard to say. \nMunicipalities naturally want to secure the campers 'site fees and other custom. \nPolice are wary of itinerants who cannot be traced to a recognized camp boundary or to four walls. \nBut most probably it will all depend upon campers themselves:how many heath fires they cause;how much litter they leave;in short, whether or not they wholly alienate landowners and those who live in the countryside. \nOnly good scouting is likely to preserve the freedoms so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout. \n\n--NIGEL BUXTON The Great Escape from The Weekend Telegraph--",
    "textTranslate": "经济是露营的一个强大动力，因为在设备的初始支出之后，或者通过租用设备，总费用可能远远低于酒店的成本。 \n但是，与普遍的假设相反，它远非唯一的，甚至不是最伟大的。 \n在欧洲无数永久性场所之一，一个不小心进入价值20英镑的空间的人可能会发现自己撞上了一辆宾利。 \n更有可能的是，福特Escort将与雷诺或梅赛德斯成为枢纽， \n但很少有双人自行车。 \n\n现代露营的装备每年都变得更加复杂，这对愤世嫉俗者来说是一个有趣的悖论，对那些发誓要摆脱这一切的充满希望的旅行者来说，这是一个更光明的前景。 \n它还提供了——一些学生社会学家可能愿意将他的论文建立在这一现象的基础上——另一种逃避。 \n现代旅行者往往是一个不喜欢Splendide和Bellavista的人，不是因为他买不起，也不是因为他回避他们的物质享受。 \n但因为他买得起。 \n他可能很富有， \n但他根本不知道该给门卫或女服务员多少小费。 \n主人在自己的房子里，他几乎不知道什么时候该对酒店领班说嘘 \n\n露营让他摆脱了所有这些恐惧。 \n诚然，露营本身基于设备和技术的势利已经存在；但如果他遇到这种情况，他很容易理解和处理。 \n在管理层和酒店等级制度中，没有比他们更优秀的“他们”来让他的假期变得黑暗。 \n\n除了这些动机，还必须添加另一个动机。 \n当代的汽车崇拜现象可以用所有权所带来的独立和自由感来解释。 \n露营给人一种精致的享受。 \n从自己的前门到家，从国外的山丘或沙滩，再回来，一切都触手可及。 \n到达度假天堂的方式不仅完全在自己的掌握和掌握之中， \n但逃离度假胜地的方法（如果海滩太拥挤，当地天气太恶劣）就在帐篷外面，或者很可能是帐篷的一部分。 \n\n理想主义者反对旅行团，认为出国旅行者因此剥夺了了解所访问国家人民的机会。 \n有人认为，孤立和自我遏制是相辅相成的。 \n这种观点在一个受欢迎的大陆露营地的经历中并不存在。 \n假日酒店往往特别为某一国籍的游客提供服务，有时甚至是独家服务。 \n相比之下，露营地是高度国际化的。 \n诚然，德国人占多数似乎是大多数地中海遗址的共同特征；但到目前为止，还没有压倒性的专业赞助。 \n禁止露天晾晒衣服、使用水龙头洗车或邀请“我们的露营朋友”参加舞会或乘船旅行的通知不仅用法语、意大利语或西班牙语印制， \n而且还有英语、德语和荷兰语。 \n在用餐时间，泡菜的气味与大蒜的气味相互竞争。 \n法国人的早餐咖啡与英国人的熏肉和鸡蛋竞争。 \n\n有组织露营的显著增长是否意味着更独立露营的最终死亡，这很难说。 \n市政当局自然希望确保露营者的场地费和其他习俗。 \n警方对无法追踪到公认的营地边界或四壁的流浪者保持警惕。 \n但最有可能的是，这一切都取决于露营者自己：他们造成了多少野火；他们留下了多少垃圾；简而言之，他们是否完全疏远了土地所有者和农村居民。 \n只有优秀的童子军才能保护这位永恒的童子军所珍视的自由。 \n\n--NIGEL BUXTON《周末电讯报》大逃亡--",
