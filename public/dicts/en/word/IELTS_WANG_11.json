一词从原义引申出“诡计”、“诈骗”、“敲诈”、“骗局”等义，最初用于英国俚语。这些词义以后渐被废弃，racket也一度消声匿迹，直至美国禁酒时期(1919 -1933)才又和其派生词racketeer（诈骗者），racketeering（敲诈勒索）二词一起在美国英语露面。1928年racketeering 一词对英国读者如此陌生，以致《每日快报》（Daily Express）不得不对此作了如下注释；“Racketeering is the new word that has been coined in America to describe the big business of organized crime.”另有一种关于racket词源的说法，认为racket乃中世纪一种骰子游戏。\n　　作“（网球等的）球拍”一义解的racket也是16世纪进入英语的，但它出自另一完全不同的词源。它借自法语raquette，源于阿拉伯语raha(t)‘palm of the hand’（手掌），因此也可拼作racquet。"},{"t":"racket:

for nothing。因此两个多世纪以来love一直被用以表示“零分”。关于这一点还有一种解释,认为在网球从法国传人英国时，love即被赋予此义。由于数字O形似蛋,所以法国人用意为“蛋”的loeuf来表示”零分\"。英国人读错音,并将它同发音近似的love相联系，久而久之就变为love."},{"t":"amateur:业余爱好者","d":"词根词缀： -am-爱 +

Military Diploma（罗马军事证书）。它由两片铜片构成，里面刻有持有人的相关信息，还有政府的烙印。铜片上留有小孔，可以用铜丝穿过小孔，把它们对折起来。\n 英语单词diploma来自古希腊文diploma，由diploun （对折）和oma（物品）构成，字面意思就是“可以对折的物品”，最早指的就是这种可以对折的铜片证书。拥有这种证书的蛮族人，可以在罗马帝国的道路和边境自由通行。后来，diploma的词义扩展，可以表示政府颁发的各种证书，如大学的文凭。\n  十八世纪，法国人开始称呼他们与外国打交道的官员为diplomat，也就是“持有diploma的人”。由diplomat一词还衍生出diplomatic（外交的）和diplomacy（外交）等词。\n diploma：[dɪ'pləʊmə] n.证书，文凭，公文\n diplomat：['dɪpləmæt] n.外交官，外交家\n diplomacy：[dɪ'pləʊməsɪ]

   少女Psyche['saiki] [希神]塞姬（爱神丘比特所爱的美女）和爱神Cupid（即希腊神话中的Eros）相恋，每晚在一座宫殿里相会。可是Cupid -再嘱咐她不要探究他的身分，也不许她窥看他的面容。日暮之后，他总是如约而来；日出之前，他便迅即离去。一天夜里，Psyche由于她的姐妹的唆使，加上自己的好奇心的驱使，在他熟睡之时，点上蜡烛偷看，方知和她相爱的人竟是众神中最俊美的爱神Cupid。她惊喜交集，手不禁颤抖了一下，一滴烛油落在他的肩上。Cupid顿时惊醒，旋即离去，从此不见，宫殿也随之消失。Psyche悔恨不已，悲恸欲绝。她四处漂游，寻觅情人，并沦为爱与美的女神Venus['vi:nəs] [罗神]维纳斯（即希腊神话中的Aphrodite）的奴隶。Venus是Cupid的母亲，对Psyche的美貌本来就十分嫉妒，她逼她干各种括儿，想方设法摧残折磨她。最后，Psyche历尽种种磨难，终于和Cupid重聚，结为夫妇，并成为灵魂、精神和生命之神。\n    追根溯源，psychology中的构词成分psycho实由Psyche演变而来。除了psychology，英语中还有不少词，诸如psychic（精神的，心理的），psychiatry（精神病学），psychoanalysis\n（精神分析），psychotic（精神病患者），psychosis（精神变态，精神病），psychopath（精神变态者），等等，均源出Psyche一词。"},{"t":"psychology:心理学，心理","d":"词根词缀：

 这种海螺在腓尼基的浅海非常多，人们便用熬出的染料来染布。由于这种紫红色的布在地中海沿岸许多国家大受欢迎，供不应求，许多腓尼基人靠贩卖染料、布匹发了财。于是他们渐渐放弃了农业生产，以经商为生。在当时，腓尼基商人的足迹遍及地中海南北各个海港。\n  英语单词purple来自希腊语porphyra，原本指的是腓尼基人所生产的这种紫色染料，后来逐渐演变为表示“紫色”这种颜色。\n

1599)的作品中还可看到napron这一形式。最后apron取代了napron。这叫做两词的错误划分( misdivision)或音节合并(coalescence／syllabic merging)。然而，与apron有亲缘关系的nap（绒毛），napery（桌布），napkin（餐巾）等词却仍然保留了首字母n。类似于apron情况的尚有umpire（仲裁人），orange（橙），adder（蝰蛇），auger（螺旋钻）等词。音节合并还会出现另一种情况。词首为元音的词有时会吸收前面的不定冠词an的字母n，使‘词形发生变化，如nickname（绰号），newt（蝾螈）原先词首并不带n。从以上某些词的字母n的得失现象我们多少可以看到口语对词的书面形式所产生的影响。(叁见napkin，nickname，umpire)"},{"t":"apron:围裙","d":"它在中世纪的原型是napron，可后来人们在口头交流中，将a
